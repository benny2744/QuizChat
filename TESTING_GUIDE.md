# QuizChat Testing Guide
## Chat Memory Fixes & Bloom's Taxonomy Improvements

🎉 **QuizChat is now running successfully on http://localhost:3001**

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### 1. Access the Application
- Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3001**
- You should see the EduChat landing page with "Transform Education with AI-Powered Learning"

### 2. Create a Teaching Session

2. Fill in the session details:
   - Session Name: "Test Session"
   - Subject: "Mathematics" (or any subject you prefer)
   - Grade Level: Select appropriate level
   - Duration: 30 minutes
3. Click **"Create Session"**
4. Note the **6-digit session code** that appears

### 3. Join as a Student (Test Chat Memory Features)
1. Open a new browser tab/window (or incognito mode)
2. Go to **http://localhost:3001**
3. Click **"Join as Student"**
4. Enter the session code and your name (e.g., "TestStudent")
5. Click **"Join Session"**

## 🧪 Feature Testing Checklist

### ✅ Feature 1: Chat Memory (AI Context Awareness)
**What to test**: AI remembers previous conversation context

**Steps**:
1. Start a conversation: "Hi, I want to learn about fractions"
2. Wait for AI response
3. Ask a follow-up: "Can you give me an example with pizza?"
4. Ask another: "What if I have 3 pizzas instead?"
5. **Expected**: AI should reference previous pizza examples and build on the conversation

### ✅ Feature 2: Chat History Loading (Session Resume)
**What to test**: Students see previous messages when rejoining

**Steps**:
1. Have a conversation with 5-6 messages
2. Close the browser tab/window
3. Rejoin the same session with the same student name
4. **Expected**: All previous messages should be loaded and visible

### ✅ Feature 3: Bloom's Taxonomy Progression
**What to test**: Questions progress from basic to advanced levels

**Steps**:
1. Start learning about any topic
2. Answer questions as they come
3. Notice the progression:
   - **Level 1-2**: "What is...?", "Define...", "Explain..."
   - **Level 3-4**: "Apply this to...", "Compare...", "Analyze..."
   - **Level 5-6**: "Evaluate...", "Create...", "Design..."
4. **Expected**: No repeated questions, clear difficulty progression

### ✅ Feature 4: Context Window Management
**What to test**: AI maintains context for recent messages (10-20 messages)

**Steps**:
1. Have a long conversation (20+ messages)
2. Reference something from 5 messages ago
3. Reference something from 15+ messages ago
4. **Expected**: AI remembers recent context but may not recall very old messages

## 🔧 Technical Verification

### Database Connection
- ✅ PostgreSQL database is connected and working
- ✅ Prisma client is generated and up-to-date
- ✅ Schema is synchronized

### API Endpoints
- ✅ Main application loads on localhost:3001
- ✅ Session creation/joining works
- ✅ Chat API processes messages (requires valid session)
- ✅ Chat history API retrieves previous conversations

### Environment Setup
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Development server running

## 🎯 Key Improvements Implemented

1. **Chat Memory**: AI now receives conversation context with each message
2. **Session Resume**: Students can leave and return without losing conversation
3. **Bloom's Taxonomy**: Educational progression from basic to advanced questions
4. **Context Management**: Efficient handling of long conversations (20 message window)
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for all scenarios

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If the application doesn't load:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/github_repos/QuizChat/app
ps aux | grep next  # Check if server is running
```

### If you need to restart the server:
```bash
# Kill existing processes
pkill -f "next dev"

# Restart server
cd /home/ubuntu/github_repos/QuizChat/app
npm run dev -- --port 3001 &
```

### If database issues occur:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/github_repos/QuizChat/app
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

## 📝 Notes for Testing
